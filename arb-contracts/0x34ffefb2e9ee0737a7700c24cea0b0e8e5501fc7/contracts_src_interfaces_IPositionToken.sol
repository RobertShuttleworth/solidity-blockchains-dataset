 * @notice Position token contract
 * @dev The `PositionToken` contract inherits from ERC20 contract and stores
 * the Id of the pool that the position token is linked to. It implements a
 * `mint` and a `burn` function which can only be called by the `PositionToken`
 * contract owner.
 *
 * Two `PositionToken` contracts are deployed during pool creation process
 * (`createContingentPool`) with Diamond contract being set as the owner.
 * The `mint` function is used during pool creation (`createContingentPool`)
 * and addition of liquidity (`addLiquidity`). Position tokens are burnt
 * during token redemption (`redeemPositionToken`) and removal of liquidity
 * (`removeLiquidity`). The address of the position tokens is stored in the
 * pool parameters within Diamond contract and used to verify the tokens that
 * a user sends back to withdraw collateral.
 *
 * Position tokens have the same number of decimals as the underlying
 * collateral token.
