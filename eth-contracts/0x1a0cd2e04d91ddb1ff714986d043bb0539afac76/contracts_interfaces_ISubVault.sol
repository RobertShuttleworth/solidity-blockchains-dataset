    /// @notice SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
    /// - Primary asset operations must be validated separately
    /// - Secondary assets require additional validation
    /// - Balance checks before all operations
    /// - Emergency mode restrictions
    /// - Proper approval management for FundVaultV2
    /// - Asset-specific transfer validations
    ///
    /// STATE MANAGEMENT:
    /// - Normal: Full functionality for all assets
    /// - Paused: No operations allowed
    /// - Emergency: Only emergency withdrawals
    /// - Primary Asset: Always supported
    /// - Secondary Assets: Can be added/removed
    ///
    /// INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
    /// - Must validate primary asset operations first
    /// - Must implement separate flows for primary/secondary assets
    /// - Must maintain accurate balances for all assets
    /// - Must emit appropriate events for tracking
    /// - Must handle FundVaultV2 interactions safely
    /// - Must implement proper access control
    ///
    /// ASSET HANDLING:
    /// Primary Asset:
    /// - Cannot be removed

    /// - Specialized event emission
    ///
    /// Secondary Assets:
    /// - Can be added/removed by admin
    /// - May require conversion logic
